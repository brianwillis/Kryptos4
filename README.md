========

Prerequisites
-------------

To build and run this application you'll need [.net core 3.1][2], which is available as a free download from Microsoft.

The application is a .net core console application written in C#. Compiled versions should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Compiling
---------

Before compiling, it's a good idea to read through [Config.cs][3] to see if any configuration needs to be set. Comments in the file explain how everything works. I've tried to choose sensible defaults. At the very least it's a good idea to specify an output folder for results to be saved in.

To build the application:

    dotnet build

To run unit tests:

    dotnet test

To run the application:

    dotnet run
